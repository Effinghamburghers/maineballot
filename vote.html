<h1>How to vote in Maine</h1>
People over 18 who have a fixed principal residence in Maine can vote in state elections.  You must register to vote in the community you live in.
<h2>Registering to vote</h2>
Maine has no deadline for registering in person at your town office or city hall.  You can also register to vote by mail up to 21 days before an election.

<h2>Voting early or by mail</h2>
Anyone can request an absentee ballot that allows you to vote by mail and many towns have early voting hours that allow you to vote in person at your town hall before election day.
